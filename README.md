# CS195-Fall24-Notebook-5

## Notebook:
It's an assignment divided into three parts. You should use these three notebooks for the corresponding experiments:
   - [_Part 1: Notebook_5_starter for FCN inference_](https://github.com/alimoorreza/CS195-Fall24-Notebook-5/blob/main/cs195_part1_inference_using_pretrained_FCN_model.ipynb).
   - [_Part 2: Notebook_5_starter for HRNet trainining using UWSv1 dataset_](https://github.com/alimoorreza/CS195-Fall24-Notebook-5/blob/main/cs195_part2_training_HRNet_model.ipynb).
   - [_Part 3: Notebook_5_starter for HRNet inference using UWSv1 dataset_](https://github.com/alimoorreza/CS195-Fall24-Notebook-5/blob/main/cs195_part3_inference_using_trained_HRNet.ipynb).

## Expectations: ☑️
You need to create a Colab notebook starting from here - [_Part 1: Notebook_5_starter for FCN inference_](https://github.com/alimoorreza/CS195-Fall24-Notebook-5/blob/main/cs195_part1_inference_using_pretrained_FCN_model.ipynb). After completing the FCN inference experiment, proceed to training HRNet model using the following [_Part 2: Notebook_5_starter for HRNet trainining using UWSv1 dataset_](https://github.com/alimoorreza/CS195-Fall24-Notebook-5/blob/main/cs195_part2_training_HRNet_model.ipynb). Finally, after training an HRNet model using UWSv1 dataset, you need to evaluate the trained model using 3 sample images (randomly selected) using the third notebook [_Part 3: Notebook_5_starter for HRNet inference using UWSv1 dataset_](https://github.com/alimoorreza/CS195-Fall24-Notebook-5/blob/main/cs195_part3_inference_using_trained_HRNet.ipynb)
Add your code and results to document your experiment.



### Rubric:
> *This assignment is worth 14 points. It will be graded using the following rubric. I strongly suggest evaluating your project using this rubric before turning it in. It consists of two criteria: 1) *writing, and 2) *code. The details of the rubrics are as follows:

| Exercise #  | Points Awarded (out of 14)  | Notes |
| --------- | ------------------- | --------- |
| 1: FCN inference on random samples using the UWSv1 dataset       |    -/7.0    |            |
| 2: HRNet training using UWSv1 dataset (train split)              |    -/3.0    |            |
| 3: HRNet inference using UWSv1 dataset (validation split)        |    -/4.0    |            |
| <b>Total                                                         |    -/14.0   |     </b>   |
